# MovieLibrary

## Description

My program is a Movie library made from C# and Blazor using the .Net framework. This movie library is runing off a server called airtable where all the movies you add get saved. The main use for my app is for users to add movies they wish to watch in the future. The user can update movies they added and delete them.
